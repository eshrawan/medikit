Throughout India, private healthcare takes the spotlight in allocating the medicines to the people of the country. The aim of the government to provide medicinal aid to the people, at a near-to-free cost, has not dwindled. Their allocation, however, is severely mismanaged. This is a kit that aims to efficiently automate the provision of medicines for individual or family use. It aims to help the government realise and study the demographic needs of medicines, vaccines, etc. in a target area and therefore reduces wastage of important medicines that could potentially save someone's life.

This could be also used as a simple reminder kit that would enable doctors to maintian connectivity with their patients and their medicine dosages.
